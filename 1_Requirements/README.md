# Discription
##  matrix calculator
Matrix Calculator is an tool that helps to perform different matrix operations on 2 x 2 matrices i.e. matrix addition, matrix subtraction, and matrix multiplication. A matrix that has the same number of rows and columns is known as a square matrix. To use this Matrix calculator, enter the numbers in the input box.

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
The project can be used by stundents and professors this can come out to be a very useful application to deal with various stuff in physics 
this project can also help student to perform calculation over 3 dimensional stuff.
## What :
this program does all the operation on the matrices required to generate a the solution for a problem .
## When :
this application can be very helpful  when a person is working on 3 dimensional stuff  
## where :
In computer graphics, they are used to project a 3-dimensional image onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the Page Rank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search.

## How :
Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. The graphics software uses the concept of a matrix to process linear transformations to render images.
